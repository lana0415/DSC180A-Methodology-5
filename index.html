        ANSWER 
        <b>What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?</b><br>

        Note: You should answer these prompts individually. If you are in a domain where the Quarter 2 Project is already determined, 
        this is still a useful (and mandatory) exercise. Do not just answer with the project you think you are doing; 
        give the questions thought and respond with possible related projects that you could work on if you get to go 
        further than expected with your current project or if your current project doesnâ€™t pan out. 
        All data scientists must have the ability to develop topics of investigation given a dataset and some domain knowledge
