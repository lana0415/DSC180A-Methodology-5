        <b>What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?</b> <br>
        <br> What I've had the most interest in so far are readings discussing <br>
        how big tech upholds and perpetuates systematic oppression. Conducting <br>
        algorithm audits are one way to reveal bias and critique the model that is being deployed. <br>
        This is what drew me to this project section.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.</b> <br>
       <br> For project 2, I think it would be interesting to look into the use of LLMs for <br>
        determining funding allocation for community projects. This would include varying <br>
        the project scope, location, income levels, etc. I would test for significant bias <br>
        and complete an analysis on the potential impacts this could have on communities.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b>What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?</b><br>
        <br>I would change the prompt type and the kind of output generated as it is harder <br>
        to analyze than outputting a quantitative number. <br>
        <br><br>
        <b>What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?</b><br>
        <br>I'd be interested to learn more about different auditing techniques for non-LLM  <br>
        models, or models that are deployed for a certain purpose and not general use.
