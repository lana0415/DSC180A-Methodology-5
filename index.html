        <b>What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?</b> <br>
        What I've had the most interest in so far are readings discussing <br>
        how big tech upholds and perpetuates systematic oppression. Conducting <br>
        algorithm audits are one way to reveal bias and critique the model that is being deployed. <br>
        This is what drew me to this project section.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.</b> <br>
        For project 2, I think it would be interesting to look into the use of LLMs for <br>
        determining funding allocation for community projects. This would include varying the project scope, location, income levels, etc.
        I would test for significant bias and complete an analysis on the potential impacts this could have on communities.
        <br>
        <b>What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?</b><br>
        I would change the prompt type and the kind of output generated as it is harder to analyze than outputting a quantitative number. 
        <br>
        <b>What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?</b><br>
        I'd be interested to learn more about different auditing techniques for non-LLM models,
        or models that are deployed for a certain purpose and not general use. 
        <br>

        Note: You should answer these prompts individually. If you are in a domain where the Quarter 2 Project is already determined, 
        this is still a useful (and mandatory) exercise. Do not just answer with the project you think you are doing; 
        give the questions thought and respond with possible related projects that you could work on if you get to go 
        further than expected with your current project or if your current project doesn’t pan out. 
        All data scientists must have the ability to develop topics of investigation given a dataset and some domain knowledge
